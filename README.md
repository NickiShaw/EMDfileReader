# EMDfileReader
Extracts metadata and individual frames from .emd files.

Exports metadata as a .csv file with specific data from each frame, this functionality was missing from any currently available software. This is especially useful for individuals with microscopy videos where the magnification or other parameters are changed during aquisition.

Currently in early stages, if you have questions or requests please email me: nashaw@uwaterloo.ca
